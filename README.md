I am a highly skilled and innovative Data Analyst and Machine Learning professional with a passion for transforming complex data into valuable business insights. I specialize in building end-to-end data solutions that foster strategic decision-making, enhance profitability, and drive process automation.

My core strength lies in bridging the gap between deep technical processes and non-technical business audiences, ensuring that data-driven insights are not only discovered but are also clearly understood and acted upon.

- üéì I have an **MSc in Data Analytics** from the University of Portsmouth  
- üíº In my previous role, I developed a machine learning model that **increased the 'hit rate' of electricity theft investigations by 29%**.
- üìà I also built a predictive failure model that led to a **15% improvement in grid reliability**.

## üöÄ My Featured Projects

Here are a few projects that showcase my ability to handle complex data challenges and deliver impactful results.

| Project | Description | Key Achievement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Feature Engineering Framework For Traffic Accident Prediction using XAI](https://github.com/cloonicux/Feature-Engineering-Framework-For-Traffic-Accident-Prediction-using-XAI)** | Developed a novel framework to predict traffic accident severity using XGBoost, LGBM, and Random Forest. The core focus was translating complex model predictions into actionable road safety insights. | **Achieved 92-93% accuracy** and demonstrated how XAI can make sophisticated models transparent and interpretable for public safety initiatives. |
| **[Critical Audit of a Fake News Detector](https://github.com/cloonicux/Fake-News-Detection)** | This project went beyond simple detection. I used LIME not just to explain predictions, but to **critically audit the model's logic**. | Discovered the model was learning spurious correlations, identifying words like "Thursday" as predictors for "fake news," highlighting the critical need for XAI in building trustworthy AI. |
| **[Credit Card Fraud Detection with Big Data](https://github.com/cloonicux/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)** | Built a high-performance classification model to detect fraudulent transactions in a large dataset of **1.8 million records** using TensorFlow, LGBM, XGBoost, and Transformers. | Engineered a robust solution that achieved an outstanding **97% to 100% accuracy** across various algorithms, showcasing my ability to handle large-scale, imbalanced datasets. |
